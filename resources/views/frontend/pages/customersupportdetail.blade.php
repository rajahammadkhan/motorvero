                    <p>
                        You will be asked to provide the description and condition of your vehicle to receive an offer. If you would like to accept the offer, you will be asked to provide a few documents to confirm your ownership of the vehicle and then schedule your pickup.
                        We may require a mechanical inspection (including a test drive) of your vehicle. This would be conducted by one of our 3rd party partners, who would come to you. On the scheduled date, your vehicle will be picked up and you will get paid. Terms and conditions apply.

                    <p>
                        Our subsidiary, CarOffer, requires 24-48 hours to review your documents, vehicle details, and history. If additional documents are needed or if we have any questions, we will also use that time to reach out to you!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3">Vehicle Inspection</h5>
                    <p>
                        Once the documents are successfully submitted, you will receive a link to complete a self-Inspection. This will be sent via SMS or email.

                        From there, you will be guided through a series of instructions to capture the cosmetic status of your vehicle. Additionally, a mechanical inspection (including a road test) may be required. If this is the case, you will be notified by our team once the pickup is scheduled.

                        If any issues or concerns are found through the inspection process, the original offer may be adjusted.
